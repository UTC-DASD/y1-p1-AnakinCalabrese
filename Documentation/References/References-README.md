# References Folder 

This is the folder to store all references that are NOT created by your team. These should be images or locations that someone can open or find quickly so they can view the reference. DO NOT place your group generated references into this folder as those should be placed into your 2D Assets folder.

You may remove these README files as you populate the folders.
